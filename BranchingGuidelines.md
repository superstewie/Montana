We intend to use a branching strategy very closely based on [GitFlow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

The branching strategy will, however, also describe how branches are related to issues and pull requests.

We intend to use a Fork and Pull strategy for external contributions.

This document shall also describe the file structure of Montana.
